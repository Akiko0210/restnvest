I was the head of the Molecular Systems Group in the Protein Homeostasis TCoE with specific focus on target identification & validation, MOA and biomarker characterization, and proteomics profiling. Using the state-of-art targeted protein degradation approach, my team aimed at targeting disease-driving proteins for proteasomal degradation to achieve therapeutic efficacy in an array of disease settings. \n\nKey responsibilities and achievements included the following:\n\n- Built from scratch and manage a 25-person drug discovery team including senior principal scientist, senior scientists, scientist II, scientist I, postdocs and research associates\n\n- Developed and implemented 3 cell-based screen platforms for HT target ID and validation including genome-wide and focused CRISPR screen, barcoded cell-panel CRISPR screen, and high-throughput protein-protein interaction screen.\n\n- Nominated novel drug targets via in-depth validation of drug tractability and disease relevance using customized and standard molecular biotechnology tools and engineered cell lines\n\n- Preclinical project and/or biology lead for 3 small-molecule degrader programs\n\n- Supported the candidate drug nominations and IND filings of  3 small-molecule degraders\n\n- Led the candidate drug nomination and IND filing of 1 small-molecule degrader\n\n- Defined rational combination and explored the mechanisms of drug response and resistance to support the phase I trial of several small-molecule degraders through hypotheses-driven mechanistic studies and unbiased genome-wide CRISPR screen\n\n- Liaised with clinical development teams to align deliverables and scientific objectives\n\n- Published 2 patents and 8 provisional patent applications",

          "description": "I conducted a 5-year postdoctoral training with Nobel Laureate Dr. William G. Kaelin Jr. at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute/HHMI/Harvard Medical School. My research focused on the characterization of the molecular mechanism by which deregulated protein ubiquitination promotes tumorigenesis, and hence provides in-depth knowledge to help design and develop better therapeutics for the treatment of cancer and other human diseases. \n\n* Established a dual-luciferase protein stability reporter platform to identify novel targets of ubiquitin E3 ligases, deubiquitinase (DUB), or agents that perturb protein degradation.\n* Identified two hematopoietic transcription factors, IKZF1 (Ikaros) and IKZF3 (Aiolos), as the target of thalidomide and its analogs, lenalidomide and pomalidomide, collectively called as immunomodulatory durgs, IMiDs. The enhanced degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos by IMiDs is both necessary and sufficient to explain the anti-myeloma activity of IMiDs.\n* Discovered oncogenic transcription factors ETS1 and ETS2 as substrates of COP1 E3 ligase, a tumor suppressor focally deleted in a variety of cancer types. Tyrosine phosphorylation of ETS1 by SRC family kinases prevents its recognition by COP1 and thereby promotes ETS1 stabilization, resulting in anchorage independent growth in triple negative breast cancer.\n\n\nRelevant publication can be found in the following link:\nhttp://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=list_works&gmla=AJsN-F7-8DNcBhcXvOEwXWrBZsL5Ag5sX9A7BWAzyKnJrLnUFTGle7oNb8pMpQBTWUZet188vTEGQTABIByTpyDbBIJ6SmSZRQ&user=O49D5bAAAAAJ",

        "description": "Dr. Maron is the Founder of MD² (pronounced MD Squared). Created in 1996, MD² developed an entirely new conceptual model for primary care medicine, which has come to be known as Concierge Medicine. Prior to founding MD², Dr. Maron ran a prestigious internal medicine practice in Seattle for over 20 years. Dr. Maron was a highly sought-after physician and cared for many of the city’s most distinguished families.  Concurrently, he also served as the team physician to the Seattle Supersonics for over a decade. After completing that tenure he was recruited to be the Medical Director for the Portland Trailblazers where he assembled the future medical team in Portland. \n\nInspired by his experience working with the Seattle Supersonics, Dr. Maron felt certain that the concept of the truly personal physician who is responsible for the care of a small group of preferred patients would result in an extraordinary caliber of service. He recognized the potential of this “custom” medical care where the doctor, equipment, pharmaceuticals and staff were all carefully curated to meet each patient’s needs. This was the genesis of MD². \n\nDr. Maron graduated from the UCLA School of Medicine. In 1977, he was awarded the UCLA Alumni Association Award for Academic Distinction. He was also awarded membership into the distinguished Alpha Omega Alpha Medical Honor Society. Dr. Maron completed his medical residency training in Internal Medicine at University of Washington Affiliated Hospitals and is certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine. \n\nDr. Maron believes that the relationship between a physician and a patient is sacred. It is this conviction that is the inspiration behind his quest to find innovations in the design and development of medical practices.",
